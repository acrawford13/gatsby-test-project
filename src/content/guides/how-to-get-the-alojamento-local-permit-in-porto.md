GuestReady has prepared an Essential Guide with the three steps required to obtain your  Licença de Alojamento Local (Short Term Rental Permit). The first is to **communicate to the Tax Authorities your new business venture** (Autoridade Tributária e Aduaneira) , and then **register the Alojamento Local (AL)** at the **Entrepreneur's Desk** (Balcão do Empreendedor) that can take up to 10 days (20 days in the case of hostels)\[^1] to be approved. After this period, you can **officially start receiving reservations,** however it is your responsibility to **ensure that you comply with certain general and safety rules** (such as having an extinguisher, fire blanket, etc.). 

After that, please keep in mind that you are still bound to some regular obligations such as the collection, form submission and payment of the **Taxa Municipal Turística** (tourist taxes), communication to the **Serviço de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras** (borders and foreigners agency), tax obligations and submit the following documents: **modelo 21-RFI** and **modelo 30**

# Definition and Modus Operandi

> Do you know exactly what is the definition of Alojamento Local (AL) and what differentiates it from another type of hospitality establishment? It is important to realize what constitutes exactly this type of unit and why so many people are choosing to monetize their home by welcoming tourists.

Estabelecimentos de Alojamento Local (Short Term Rental) are those providing temporary accommodation services - namely to tourists, in exchange for payment - provided they do not qualify as touristic developments.

There are several types of establishments in which your Alojamento Local can operate:

<PanelWrapper><Panel heading="Single-family detached home">Alojamento local establishment whose unit of accommodation is constituted by an autonomous building, of a single-family house</Panel><Panel heading="Apartment">Alojamento local establishment whose accommodation unit consists of an autonomous fraction of a building or part of an urban building susceptible of independent use.</Panel></PanelWrapper>

# What are _áreas de contenção_?

The increase of tourist inflow and consequently the surge in _Alojamento Local_ units in metropolitan areas, especially in areas with greater public interest, has caused - in addition to the positive impact associated with this economic activity - the need to implement regulations, protecting the balance between local life and tourism. The product of this regulation was reflected in the conditioning, in the form of a containment area, access to new permits in order to preserve the social reality of neighborhoods.

Today, **city ​​councils can implement _áreas de contenção_**, by _freguesia_, in whole or in part, which **conditions access to new permits to own your _Alojamento Local_**, which may take into account percentage limits in proportion to properties available for housing. Established containment areas **should be re-evaluated** at least **every two years**.

In these areas **limits can be imposed** in relation to the **number of establishments**, requiring new applications for permits in that territory of clear authorization from the _Câmara Municipal_ and, in case of deferment, promotes its registration.

In Lisbon, for instance - where containment areas are already a reality - the law has established that, in these areas, the same owner can only operate a maximum of seven AL establishments, in addition owners who on October 21st 2018 exceed this limit can not affect more real estate to their short term rental business.

**Permits suspension: Municipalities** may - under reasoned proposal of the city hall - **suspend**, for a **maximum of one year**, the **authorization of new permits** in specifically defined areas, until the new legislation is instated.

# Obtain your Alojamento Local Permit

## Step 1 - Register with the Finanças

> In order to start earning money from your property you must start by divulging to the Autoridade Tributária e Aduaneira (Portuguese Tax Authority) of your new professional endeavours. As an Empresário em Nome Individual (Standard Sole Trader) you must register as Category B Rendimentos empresariais e profissionais (Business and professional earnings) with the IRS , in order to register to taxes. In order to register with organized accounting, you must deal with an official accountant.

There are two types of taxing systems in Portugal - the Empresário em Nome Individual or ENI in which the standard alone trader manages his accounting autonomously (until he reaches 200,000 euros of annual billing), and the Regime de Contabilidade Organizada (organized accounting regime) that requires you to hire a Técnico Oficial de Contas (official accountant) to validate and review your economic activity. Although it is true that with a business owner that operates within the organized accounting system and that generates more than 200 000 euros in annual revenue it is obliged to have a certified accountant, he or she can choose to have said accountant regardless of the turnover ammount.

Since you need a certified accountant when you operate in the Regime de Contabilidade Organizada (organized accounting system), the information in this guide is written with the Empresário em Nome Individual or ENI (Standard Sole Trader) in mind.

In the ENI regime, the tax of 28% in relation to category F - Property Income) falls on 35% of the income. The remaining 65% is not subject to tax since they it is seen as operating costs.

If, for example, an owner has a yearly turnover of € 1000 (which represents 100% of their annual income), only € 350 (35%) will be subject to 28% tax (relative to the current tax rate for alojamento local):

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

€ 1000 (100%) - € 350 (35%) = € 650<br/>350 € - 28% = € 98 (tax value you would pay)
