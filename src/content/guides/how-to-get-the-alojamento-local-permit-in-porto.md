GuestReady has prepared an Essential Guide with the three steps required to obtain your  Licença de Alojamento Local (Short Term Rental Permit). The first is to **communicate to the Tax Authorities your new business venture** (Autoridade Tributária e Aduaneira), and then **register the Alojamento Local (AL)** at the **Entrepreneur's Desk** (Balcão do Empreendedor) that can take up to 10 days (20 days in the case of hostels) to be approved. After this period, you can **officially start receiving reservations,** however it is your responsibility to **ensure that you comply with certain general and safety rules** (such as having an extinguisher, fire blanket, etc.). 

After that, please keep in mind that you are still bound to some regular obligations such as the collection, form submission and payment of the **Taxa Municipal Turística** (tourist taxes), communication to the **Serviço de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras** (borders and foreigners agency), tax obligations and submit the following documents: **modelo 21-RFI** and **modelo 30**

# Definition and Modus Operandi

> Do you know exactly what is the definition of Alojamento Local (AL) and what differentiates it from another type of hospitality establishment? It is important to realize what constitutes exactly this type of unit and why so many people are choosing to monetize their home by welcoming tourists.

**Estabelecimentos de Alojamento Local** (Short Term Rental) are those **providing temporary accommodation services** - namely to tourists, **in exchange for payment** - provided they do not qualify as touristic developments.

There are several types of establishments in which your Alojamento Local can operate:

<PanelWrapper>
<CollapsiblePanel headingImageUrl="1.2-single-family-detached-home.jpg" heading="Single-family detached home">
Alojamento local establishment whose unit of accommodation is constituted by an autonomous building, of a single-family house
</CollapsiblePanel>
<CollapsiblePanel headingImageUrl="2-appartments.jpg" heading="Apartment">
Alojamento local establishment in which the accommodation unit consists of an autonomous fraction of a building or part of an urban building susceptible of independent use
</CollapsiblePanel>
<CollapsiblePanel headingImageUrl="3-accommodation-establishments.jpg" heading="Accommodation establishment">
alojamento local establishment whose accommodation units consist of rooms, integrated in an autonomous fraction of an edifice, in an urban building or in a part of an urban buildings susceptible to independent use. These may use the hostel denomination when the predominant housing unit is a dormitory, ie when the number of users is higher than the number of users in a room, and if they comply with the other requirements for this accommodation type.
</CollapsiblePanel>
<CollapsiblePanel headingImageUrl="5-rooms.jpg" heading="Rooms">
alojamento local establishment that operates in the same address as the host’s official residence [the same as his residência fiscal (official address for tax purposes)] when the accommodation unit is a bedroom and the maximum number of bedrooms is not superior to three.

# What are áreas de contenção?

> The increase of tourist inflow and consequently the surge in _Alojamento Local_ units in metropolitan areas, especially in areas with greater public interest, has caused - in addition to the positive impact associated with this economic activity - the need to implement regulations, protecting the balance between local life and tourism. The product of this regulation was reflected in the conditioning, in the form of a containment area, access to new permits in order to preserve the social reality of neighborhoods.

Today, **city ​​councils can implement áreas de contenção**, by _freguesia_, in whole or in part, which **conditions access to new permits to own your _Alojamento Local_**, which may take into account percentage limits in proportion to properties available for housing. Established containment areas **should be re-evaluated** at least **every two years**.

In these areas **limits can be imposed** in relation to the **number of establishments**, requiring new applications for permits in that territory of clear authorization from the _Câmara Municipal_ and, in case of deferment, promotes its registration.

In Lisbon, for instance - where containment areas are already a reality - the law has established that, in these areas, the same owner can only operate a maximum of seven AL establishments, in addition owners who on October 21st 2018 exceed this limit can not affect more real estate to their short term rental business.

**Permits suspension: Municipalities** may - under reasoned proposal of the city hall - **suspend**, for a **maximum of one year**, the **authorization of new permits** in specifically defined areas, until the new legislation is instated.

# Obtain your _Alojamento Local_ Permit

## Step 1 - Register with the Finanças

> In order to start earning money from your property you must start by divulging to the Autoridade Tributária e Aduaneira (Portuguese Tax Authority) of your new professional endeavours. As an Empresário em Nome Individual (Standard Sole Trader) you must register as Category B Rendimentos empresariais e profissionais (Business and professional earnings) with the IRS[^ IRS - Imposto sobre o Rendimento de Pessoas Singulares (Individual Income Tax)], in order to register to taxes. In order to register with organized accounting, you must deal with an official accountant.

There are two types of taxing systems in Portugal - the Empresário em Nome Individual or ENI in which the standard alone trader manages his accounting autonomously (until he reaches 200,000 euros of annual billing), and the Regime de Contabilidade Organizada (organized accounting regime) that requires you to hire a Técnico Oficial de Contas (official accountant) to validate and review your economic activity. Although it is true that with a business owner that operates within the organized accounting system and that generates more than 200 000 euros in annual revenue it is obliged to have a certified accountant, he or she can choose to have said accountant regardless of the turnover amount.

Since you need a certified accountant when you operate in the Regime de Contabilidade Organizada (organized accounting system), the information in this guide is written with the Empresário em Nome Individual or ENI (Standard Sole Trader) in mind.

In the ENI regime, the tax of 28% in relation to category F - Property Income) falls on 35% of the income. The remaining 65% is not subject to tax since they it is seen as operating costs.

If, for example, an owner has a yearly turnover of € 1000 (which represents 100% of their annual income), only € 350 (35%) will be subject to 28% tax (relative to the current tax rate for alojamento local):

<div className="calculation-highlighted">

€ 1000 (100%) - € 350 (35%) = € 650<br/>350 € - 28% = € 98 (amount subject to tax value)[^ 28% is the percentage of IRS for category F income, in which case income is taxed at 100%. When you opt for being taxed in category B, your income are taxed at 35%.][^ This calculation is a general simulation and does not dispense with more detailed consultation according to your tax regime and to the tax authority.]

</div>

### How to Register in Tax Authority

**In the Comunicação Prévia (Prior Communication) must include the following information and documents (print the checklist):**

* **The autorização de utilização (usage permit) or título de utilização válido do imóvel (valid property usage title);**

    A autorização de utilização (usage permit) is a legal document issued by the city council of the property, that defines the type of use allowed for a particular building or fraction: housing, or non-residential purposes (trade, services or industry). This document certifies that the property or fraction meets all legal requirements (safety against fire hazards, health, habitability, for example), to be used, whether for residential or other purposes, related to any branch of activity.
    
    To obtain this document, you must go to the City Hall where the property is located:

    Note that this person is also jointly responsible with the guests for the damage caused by them in the building.

    The accountable person, may not be the property owner and in that case, he or she must join a rental agreement or other document that refers their authorization.

# Some final considerations

## Regular obligations

It is important to know what regular obligations you will have to fulfill now that you have started your activity of operating an Alojamento Local: 

### Tourist Municipal Fee

The Taxa Municipal Turística (TMT) (Municipal Tourist Tax) was created with the objective of reducing the effects caused by tourism growth and should be charged by tourism establishments and Alojamento Local units to their guests.

To the TMT - is not applied VAT and in Porto has the value of two euros per guests starting at age thirteen, per night, up to seven nights.

Airbnb collects automatically, in a protocol that it has with the City Council; However, other booking platforms require the owner to handle this by doing the monthly or quarterly self-settlement, through a platform created by the municipalities that charge this fee.

### Communication to the SEF

The Serviço de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras (SEF), Borders and Foreigners Agency obliges every party that provides accommodation in exchange for payment to foreign citizens, to communicate so, within three working days, by means of an accommodation bulletin, directly on the SEF portal or, in the locations where it does not exist, the Republican National Guard or the Public Security Police.

We advise you to apply for access to the SEF following the previous steps, as it may take 48 hours to complete the registration process.

**How to do it:**

We advise you to register as soon as you finish the first steps as it may take up to 48 hours to complete your registration. Registration is done on the [SIBA](https://siba.sef.pt/s/an/DadosIdentificacao.aspx) website, where you have to enter your e-mail, fill in the form with your information, wait 48 hours to receive the activation key with the establishment code in your e-mail

For each reservation, it’s necessary to obtain identification information of each guest per property to be communicated to the SEF.

### Tax Obligations

As with any business, once you have an open economic activity it has to comply with certain regular tax obligations. If you have organized accounting you will need to consult with your accountant. If you are registered under the simplified procedure - that is to say, the self-employed person deals with his accounts autonomously and must:

Issue a receipt up to 5 days after receipt of reservation amount, or 5 days after check-in.

If you do not invoice directly in the Tax Authority’s online portal, you must send the receipts issued the previous month via the SAF-T to this entity by the 15th of each month;

Deliver the periodic VAT return (if you are not exempt). If it is exempt, check if you have invoices with reverse charge , and deliver the respective VAT in the following month;

Deliver [Model 30](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&prev=_t&sl=pt-BR&tl=en&u=http://info.portaldasfinancas.gov.pt/pt/apoio_contribuinte/modelos_formularios/irs_irc/Documents/M30-BF-04.pdf.pdf) (income paid to non-residents), until the second month after payment of the income (Commissions or Services). It should be noted that if you do not have the [Model RFI21](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&prev=_t&sl=pt-BR&tl=en&u=http://info.portaldasfinancas.gov.pt/pt/apoio_contribuinte/modelos_formularios/convencoes_dupla_trib_internacional/Documents/mod2_rfi.pdf) of the entities to which you make payments, must withholding tax of 25%
