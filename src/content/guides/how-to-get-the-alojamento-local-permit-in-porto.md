GuestReady has prepared an Essential Guide with the three steps required to obtain your  Licença de Alojamento Local (Short Term Rental Permit). The first is to **communicate to the Tax Authorities your new business venture** (Autoridade Tributária e Aduaneira) , and then **register the Alojamento Local (AL)** at the **Entrepreneur's Desk** (Balcão do Empreendedor) that can take up to 10 days (20 days in the case of hostels) to be approved. After this period, you can **officially start receiving reservations,** however it is your responsibility to **ensure that you comply with certain general and safety rules** (such as having an extinguisher, fire blanket, etc.). 

After that, please keep in mind that you are still bound to some regular obligations such as the collection, form submission and payment of the **Taxa Municipal Turística** (tourist taxes), communication to the **Serviço de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras** (borders and foreigners agency), tax obligations and submit the following documents: **modelo 21-RFI** and **modelo 30**

# Definition and Modus Operandi

> Do you know exactly what is the definition of Alojamento Local (AL) and what differentiates it from another type of hospitality establishment? It is important to realize what constitutes exactly this type of unit and why so many people are choosing to monetize their home by welcoming tourists.

Estabelecimentos de Alojamento Local (Short Term Rental) are those providing temporary accommodation services - namely to tourists, in exchange for payment - provided they do not qualify as touristic developments.

There are several types of establishments in which your Alojamento Local can operate:

<PanelWrapper><Panel heading="Single-family detached home">Alojamento local establishment whose unit of accommodation is constituted by an autonomous building, of a single-family house</Panel><Panel heading="Apartment">Alojamento local establishment whose accommodation unit consists of an autonomous fraction of a building or part of an urban building susceptible of independent use.</Panel></PanelWrapper>

<Note>Note: When placing the check ✓ in the Transmissões Intracomunitárias, corresponding to the VAT Information Exchange System (VIES), - when you create your property profile in the booking platforms, you must then inform them that you activated the VIES and future invoices with their commission must not include VAT.</Note>
